How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
In the CRUD Python module, I focused on clean, modular code that separated each function (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for ease of readability and reusability. By using object-oriented principles, I kept the code flexible for future changes, making it easier to add new features or alter existing ones. The advantages of this approach, especially in Project Two, were that the backend functionality was already set up, allowing me to quickly connect the dashboard widgets to the database with minimal changes. In the future, this CRUD module could be adapted to other projects requiring database interaction, such as inventory management systems or user authentication systems.
 
How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
When approaching the database or dashboard requirements for Grazioso Salvare, I broke the project down into smaller tasks, starting with setting up the database, then implementing CRUD functionality, and finally connecting it to the dashboard. This approach helped me stay organized and focused. Compared to previous assignments, like those in earlier courses, this project felt more like real-world application development, where I had to ensure the system was scalable and interacted with multiple components. In future database projects, I would use techniques like creating detailed project requirements, considering future scalability, and ensuring security features are in place from the beginning.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
Computer scientists design systems and solve problems using computational techniques. In this project, my work directly supported Grazioso Salvare's goal of managing animal records through a database and interactive dashboard. By ensuring that the database is efficient and the dashboard is responsive, I helped the company streamline its operations. This type of project would allow them to manage data more effectively, making informed decisions quicker. Computer scientists are essential for creating systems that improve efficiency, scalability, and user experience in any business.
